<h2>Decentralized Community Network (DCN)</h2>

<p>
  The <strong>Decentralized Community Network (DCN)</strong> is envisioned as a federated, self-hosted platform empowering intentional communities with autonomy and resilience.
</p>

<p>
  Communities often strive for “place-based” sustainability and appropriate technology that reduce reliance on external infrastructure. DCN embraces this by running on affordable local servers (e.g., Raspberry Pis or LAN servers) and using open protocols to ensure the community controls its own data and identity.
</p>

<p>
  Its core values are <strong>autonomy</strong>, <strong>collaboration</strong>, and <strong>openness</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  By leveraging modern open-source tools and decentralized networks, DCN provides members with collaboration, recordkeeping, e-commerce, and communication tools that align with community values.
</p>

## Architecture Overview


<p>
  DCN is built on a modular microservices architecture: all nodes run the same core software suite, but they can specialize in different roles. Each node hosts key DCN services (database, API, storage, etc.) as containers, orchestrated by Docker Compose for simplicity.
</p>

<p>
  The system uses Supabase as the backend (self-hosted PostgreSQL with Realtime and Auth) and Refine for the administrative UI. Each node communicates peer-to-peer and synchronizes content using decentralized protocols.
</p>

<p>
  Unlike a monolithic platform, DCN’s microservices approach ensures that components (e-commerce, chat, media) are loosely coupled: a failure or update in one service does not bring down others. This yields fault isolation and scalability, essential for a local mesh network that may have intermittent connectivity.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Illustrative DCN network:</strong> Peer-to-peer nodes connect over LAN or the Internet. Each node runs the full DCN stack but may prioritize certain services based on its role. Each node type in DCN can act as a logical “microservice” in the broader community cluster—for example, a Logistics Node focuses on inventory and supply-chain modules, while an Educational Node prioritizes course and tutorial sharing.
</p>

<p>
  All nodes remain part of a single distributed system with no central server. Data replication is eventually consistent: content updates flow via signed messages and can also leverage file synchronization for resilience. The DCN overlay network is designed so that every node is equally privileged, with no single point of control.
</p>

## Node Types and Custom Profiles


<p>
  DCN supports multiple node profiles – each running the same software stack but configured for a particular community role. On first run, a setup wizard prompts the administrator to select a node type and preferred modules.
</p>

<h3>Example Node Types:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Community Node:</strong> General-purpose hub. Emphasizes social forums, member directories, event calendars, and community dashboards.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Logistics Node:</strong> Focuses on inventory, supply chain, and marketplace. Prioritizes e-commerce, order tracking, and shared resources.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Outlet Node:</strong> Acts as a storefront or local vendor portal. Prioritizes the marketplace module, payment integration, and customer management.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Educational Node:</strong> Centers on learning and training. Enables course creation, resource libraries, assignments, and collaborative study tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Data Mirror Node:</strong> Provides redundancy and backup. Mirrors data from other nodes using technologies like database replication or IPFS.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Research Node:</strong> Focuses on analytics and R&D. Emphasizes data visualization, knowledge management, and integration with scientific tools.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each node type has a dashboard view tailored to its mission: relevant widgets and navigation are highlighted, while less-used modules remain available.
</p>

<p>
  For example, an <strong>Educational Node</strong> foregrounds “Courses” and “Tutorials,” whereas an <strong>Outlet Node</strong> highlights “Products” and “Orders.” Technically, this is implemented via a role flag in the database; the frontend (built with Refine) shows or hides UI sections accordingly.
</p>

<p>
  This flexible profile system allows DCN to scale from small co-ops to large federated networks without code forks or siloed platforms.
</p>

<h3>Initial Setup and Automation</h3>

<p>
  During initial setup, a Node-Setup Wizard (CLI or web) uses the selected profile to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preconfigure the database schema using Supabase SQL migrations</li>
  <li>Enable relevant service containers</li>
  <li>Seed default content and UI</li>
  <li>Generate encryption keys (e.g., for Nostr identities)</li>
  <li>Create initial user roles</li>
  <li>Configure local network settings (LAN IP, hostname)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This ensures that each DCN instance boots up with minimal manual setup and can be reconfigured or repurposed later via the built-in admin UI.
</p>


## Backend Infrastructure (Supabase)


<p>
  The DCN backend is built on <strong>Supabase</strong>, an open-source alternative to Firebase. Supabase provides a PostgreSQL database, Row-Level Security (RLS), real-time subscriptions, user authentication, and object storage — all essential for a modern collaboration platform.
</p>

<p>
  Crucially, Supabase can be fully self-hosted using Docker Compose, ensuring that all data remains on the local LAN without reliance on external cloud infrastructure.
</p>

<h3>Typical DCN Deployment Stack</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Database (Postgres):</strong> Stores all structured data including users, posts, products, and sensor logs. Supports SQL queries and features like full-text search.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Realtime Server:</strong> Pushes live updates over WebSockets. Enables real-time collaboration (e.g., chat, document editing) by broadcasting changes instantly to connected clients.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Auth & User Profiles:</strong> Manages user accounts with email or key-based authentication (e.g., Nostr). Also supports OAuth/SAML for integrations with existing identity systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Storage:</strong> Manages file uploads (images, videos, attachments) and serves them via a built-in CDN layer. Ideal for media-rich modules such as e-commerce or galleries.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Edge Functions (Optional):</strong> Enables custom server-side logic via Deno-based Supabase Edge Functions or Dockerized microservices. Useful for workflows, automation, and event triggers.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Admin Interface and Local Development</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Supabase Studio</strong> (the dashboard UI) is installed locally, providing a visual interface for managing database schemas, auth settings, and file storage — all from within the community's LAN.
</p>

<p>
  Developers and admins can use the <strong>Supabase CLI</strong> (<code>supabase init</code>, <code>supabase start</code>) for local development and database migrations.
</p>

<p>
  For offline or restricted environments, a USB-based installer can include all Supabase container images and necessary tools, enabling a completely offline-capable backend stack.
</p>

## Frontend and Admin UI (Refine)


<p>
  The DCN user interface is powered by <strong>Refine</strong>, a React-based framework optimized for data-centric applications. Refine simplifies the creation of CRUD interfaces, dashboards, and data grids — enabling rapid development with minimal boilerplate.
</p>

<p>
  It includes built-in integration with Supabase, automatically generating <code>authProvider</code> and <code>dataProvider</code> hooks. Developers can scaffold admin panels for any table (e.g., members, events, products) in just a few lines of code.
</p>

<h3>Key Frontend Technologies & Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>UI Framework:</strong> Refine supports multiple design systems including Material-UI, Ant Design, and Mantine. A clean, responsive theme is recommended for use across community environments.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Layouts & Theming:</strong> Communities can customize their node’s appearance with logos, color schemes, and layout options. Night/day modes and full localization support are built in.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dashboard Widgets:</strong> Refine supports charts and metric cards (via Recharts, Chart.js, etc.) that reflect real-time data. For example, Logistics Nodes might show inventory levels, while Educational Nodes show course progress.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Refine integrates with Supabase Realtime to push live updates to UI components — ideal for chat, task queues, and collaborative modules.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Authentication Flows:</strong> Using <code>@refinedev/supabase</code>, Refine handles login, signup, password reset, and 2FA. Identity options include email, OAuth, and even key-based logins for privacy-focused communities.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Architecture & Customization</h3>

<p>
  Refine’s modular architecture leverages React Context Providers to isolate logic and UI concerns. This allows components to be reused across modules — for instance, a <code>PostList</code> can serve both as a blog and a course discussion board with only minor configuration changes.
</p>

<p>
  Admins can manage system settings (e.g., user roles, payment gateways) through a friendly UI — no coding required. For more advanced needs, developers can use DCN’s exposed GraphQL or REST APIs (via PostgREST and Supabase) to build custom frontends or mobile apps.
</p>

## Core Functional Modules

<p>
  DCN includes a set of modules designed to meet the common needs of intentional communities. Each module is an encapsulated service or schema that integrates directly into the platform, whether locally hosted or synced from external tools.
</p>

<h3>Core Modules</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Discussion Forums / Chat:</strong> Choose between a modern forum platform like <a href="https://nodebb.org" target="_blank">NodeBB</a> (Node.js, mobile-ready, threaded discussions) or a federated chat network like <a href="https://matrix.org" target="_blank">Matrix</a> (Synapse or Dendrite). Both support roles, moderation, and embedding via widgets or Nostr-based feeds.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>E-commerce / Marketplace:</strong> Integrate <a href="https://medusajs.com" target="_blank">Medusa.js</a> (headless commerce, Node.js) for managing products, orders, and payments (via Stripe, crypto, etc.). Alternatively, use simple Supabase tables with Refine UI for smaller shops.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Project & Task Management:</strong> Build Kanban boards using Supabase and <code>react-beautiful-dnd</code> in Refine, or integrate full-featured tools like <a href="https://www.openproject.org" target="_blank">OpenProject</a> or <a href="https://www.taiga.io" target="_blank">Taiga</a>. Offline-capable task tracking is supported with CRDTs (e.g., Yjs).
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Education & Tutorials:</strong> Support learning with Supabase-based courses, quizzes, and markdown content — or run a full LMS like <a href="https://moodle.org" target="_blank">Moodle</a> or Canvas. Use <a href="https://joinpeertube.org" target="_blank">PeerTube</a> for video streaming and build “Digital Libraries” for offline-first education.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Agriculture & Sustainability:</strong> Integrate tools like <a href="https://farmos.org" target="_blank">farmOS</a> or <a href="https://litefarm.org" target="_blank">LiteFarm</a> for crop planning and farm records. Sensor data from MQTT/IoT devices can be visualized in dashboards (e.g., soil moisture trends).
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Media and File Sharing:</strong> Use <a href="https://joinpeertube.org" target="_blank">PeerTube</a> (federated video) and <a href="https://funkwhale.audio" target="_blank">Funkwhale</a> (audio/podcasts) for media distribution. General file sync is handled by Supabase Storage or <a href="https://syncthing.net" target="_blank">Syncthing</a> for decentralized document sharing.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Dashboards & Visualization:</strong> Display analytics (sales, energy, growth) via <code>Chart.js</code> or <code>Recharts</code>. For advanced use cases, connect <a href="https://redash.io" target="_blank">Redash</a> or <a href="https://superset.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Superset</a> to Supabase’s Postgres backend.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Other Features:</strong> Add polls, calendars, wikis, or map-based tools as needed. New modules simply extend the Supabase schema and Refine UI, and all respect Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure privacy and permission control.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Offline-First by Design</h3>
<p>
  Every DCN module supports an <strong>offline-first workflow</strong>. All content created locally (posts, records, tasks, etc.) should remain accessible without internet. When reconnected, changes are synced using CRDTs (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs" target="_blank">Yjs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge" target="_blank">Automerge</a>) to enable automatic conflict resolution and distributed collaboration.
</p>

## Communication and Synchronization Protocols


<p>
  DCN leverages a combination of decentralized protocols to connect community nodes, enabling data resilience, identity portability, and robust content delivery even in low-connectivity environments.
</p>

<h3>Key Protocols</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays):</strong>
    A lightweight decentralized messaging protocol using public/private key pairs for identity. Users in DCN can use their <a href="https://nostr.com" target="_blank">Nostr</a> public key as a persistent identity. Forum posts, announcements, and messages can be published to Nostr relays, enabling censorship resistance and decentralized identity management. DCN nodes may host their own relays or connect to shared ones.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):</strong>
    For large file sharing (videos, PDFs, datasets), <a href="https://ipfs.tech" target="_blank">IPFS</a> enables distributed, content-addressed storage. DCN nodes can pin each other's content to keep it available even if the original uploader is offline. IPFS content hashes can be saved in Supabase for easy reference and retrieval.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Matrix Protocol:</strong>
    A federated protocol for real-time chat and VoIP. <a href="https://matrix.org" target="_blank">Matrix</a> servers (Synapse or Dendrite) allow communities to self-host chat services, mirroring Nostr relays or serving as backup messaging layers. As an "eventually consistent global JSON database", Matrix ensures reliable event delivery and searchable history.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Syncthing:</strong>
    A peer-to-peer sync tool for direct LAN file exchange. <a href="https://syncthing.net" target="_blank">Syncthing</a> allows shared folders (e.g., documents, backups) to automatically sync across DCN nodes without requiring cloud storage. Ideal for low-bandwidth setups and private offline networks, with end-to-end encryption.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Resilience Through Redundancy</h3>
<p>
  These protocols are layered to ensure continuity even during partial outages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Messaging and Identity:</strong> Nostr + Matrix</li>
  <li><strong>Content Distribution:</strong> IPFS + Supabase references</li>
  <li><strong>File/Data Synchronization:</strong> Syncthing + Supabase backups</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This approach enables "data hopping" across channels. For example, if the internet is down, LAN nodes may still sync files via Syncthing. Once reconnected, IPFS and Nostr allow them to resync content and messages. No single point of failure means stronger autonomy for each node.
</p>

## Offline Support and Data Integrity

<p>
  DCN is built with offline-first principles, ensuring core functionality persists during partial or full disconnection from the internet. This enables communities to remain productive even in isolated or unreliable network conditions.
</p>

<h3>Key Strategies</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>CRDT Data Structures:</strong>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type" target="_blank">Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)</a> enable collaborative editing without data conflicts. Libraries like <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs" target="_blank">Yjs</a> offer shared maps, arrays, and text types that automatically merge peer updates. For example, a shared meeting notes document edited on multiple nodes will eventually converge to a consistent state.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Local Caching:</strong>
    The frontend uses local storage technologies (IndexedDB, Service Workers) to cache data, so users can browse recent content while offline. Tools like <a href="https://rxdb.info/" target="_blank">RxDB</a> act as an offline-first client database, queuing changes and syncing them to Supabase when connectivity returns. Static assets (JavaScript, CSS, images) are also cached for fast load times.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Database Replication:</strong>
    Critical data (users, settings, content schemas) can be backed up or replicated across nodes. DCN supports PostgreSQL’s built-in replication for LAN-based mirroring, or can use application-level scripts to periodically export/import Supabase tables. This ensures continuity even if one server fails.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Integrity and Conflict Resolution:</strong>
    Message authenticity is ensured through <a href="https://nostr.com" target="_blank">Nostr</a> signatures, and data integrity through <a href="https://ipfs.tech" target="_blank">IPFS</a> content hashes. When edit conflicts occur, DCN resolves them using CRDTs or a Last-Write-Wins strategy coordinated with vector clocks.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Workflow</h3>
<p>
  A user updates a task list and adds a forum post while disconnected. These edits are stored in the browser via RxDB and merged using Yjs when the node reconnects. The post is signed with their Nostr key and broadcast via relays; the task list is synced to Supabase and visible in dashboards. Meanwhile, file changes in a shared folder sync via Syncthing to neighboring LAN nodes.
</p>
## Identity and Security
<p>
  DCN provides flexible identity options and robust security practices that prioritize user sovereignty and community control.
</p>

<h3>Decentralized Identity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Traditional Login:</strong> Users may authenticate using standard email/password credentials via <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth" target="_blank">Supabase Auth</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cryptographic Identity:</strong> Every user or node can generate a <em>Nostr</em> public/private key pair. The public key serves as the user’s global ID, while all activity (posts, votes, messages) is cryptographically signed and verifiable (<a href="https://nostr.com" target="_blank">nostr.com</a>). This enables self-sovereign identities without requiring a centralized user database.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Trust Networks & DIDs:</strong> Communities can layer on trust networks or optional <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" target="_blank">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> for interoperable identity verification and reputation tracking.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Transport & Data Security</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Encrypted Communication:</strong> All HTTP and WebSocket traffic is encrypted using TLS. Additional protocols like <a href="https://syncthing.net" target="_blank">Syncthing</a> and <a href="https://anarc.at/matrix-intro" target="_blank">Matrix</a> provide end-to-end encryption by default for file sync and chat.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Encrypted Storage:</strong> Data at rest—including sensitive files or private content—can be encrypted on disk to prevent unauthorized access, even if hardware is compromised.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Access Control</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Row-Level Security (RLS):</strong> Supabase’s RBAC system enforces fine-grained access rules. For example, only authenticated community members may see internal discussions, while general visitors access public data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cross-Node Trust:</strong> Nodes in a trusted federation may share a root Certificate Authority (CA) to mutually verify SSL/TLS traffic. Alternatively, built-in secure channels (Nostr and Matrix) can serve as authenticated and encrypted tunnels between nodes.
  </li>
</ul>
## Deployment, Packaging and Setup
<p>
  DCN is designed for rapid, resilient deployment in both connected and offline environments. From Raspberry Pi clusters to data center nodes, installation is streamlined and repeatable.
</p>

<h3>Containerized Infrastructure</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Single Manifest:</strong> All core services—<a href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank">Supabase</a>, Refine frontend, optional <a href="https://mosquitto.org/" target="_blank">MQTT broker</a>, <a href="https://ipfs.tech" target="_blank">IPFS daemon</a>, and others—are defined in a single <code>docker-compose.yml</code> or Helm chart (for <a href="https://k3s.io" target="_blank">k3s</a> clusters). Admins can deploy with a single command: <code>docker-compose up -d</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prebuilt Docker Images:</strong> Official DCN images are published to a registry and optionally bundled into a tarball for USB deployment. First-time installs run <code>./install.sh</code> to import images (<code>docker load</code>), apply firewall rules, and launch the stack.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>First-Run Wizard</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Upon first launch, a setup wizard (web-based or CLI) prompts for:
    <ul>
      <li>Network mode: LAN-only or Internet-enabled</li>
      <li>Node role and metadata</li>
      <li>Admin user credentials</li>
      <li>Supabase secret config and schema initialization</li>
      <li>Generate/import a Nostr identity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The wizard uses Supabase CLI tools to apply schema migrations and seed initial data sets based on selected modules.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Offline Installations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    For disconnected environments (e.g., homesteads, disaster relief), DCN supports:
    <ul>
      <li>USB-based image and package transfer</li>
      <li>Offline APT/YUM mirror setup for OS-level dependencies</li>
      <li>Local Supabase CLI usage without external API calls</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Maintenance & Upgrades</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A scheduled container handles automated backups—dumping the Postgres DB and syncing directories to USB, SSD, or network-attached storage.
  </li>
  <li>
    New DCN versions ship as updated container images. The Admin UI includes tools to apply Supabase schema migrations safely and update in-place.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Network Discovery & Federation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    DCN uses <a href="https://www.avahi.org/" target="_blank">mDNS/Avahi</a> for local peer discovery. Nodes automatically form a private LAN mesh when detected.
  </li>
  <li>
    Long-distance federations can use static DNS records or known peer IDs to connect across the Internet using end-to-end encrypted channels.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Federation Model</h3>

<p>
  DCN nodes operate independently but can link into a broader “community of communities.” Each node runs a web UI accessible over the LAN. Federated nodes can optionally interconnect over the internet via:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Nostr:</strong> Lightweight key-based communication for chat and identity sync.</li>
  <li><strong>VPN Bridges:</strong> Static tunnels to link remote nodes into a trusted mesh.</li>
  <li><strong>mDNS/Avahi:</strong> Auto-discovery of peers on local networks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This mesh of federated, self-hosted servers allows communities to collaborate without dependency on centralized infrastructure.
</p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p>
  The <strong>Decentralized Community Network (DCN)</strong> is a modular, self-hosted collaboration platform built with <a href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank">Supabase</a> and <a href="https://refine.dev" target="_blank">Refine</a>, tailored for intentional and sustainable communities. DCN integrates:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Offline-first design (CRDTs, local caching, peer syncing)</li>
  <li>Peer-to-peer protocols (Nostr, IPFS, Matrix, Syncthing)</li>
  <li>Rich functionality (e-commerce, LMS, media, forums, etc.)</li>
  <li>Containerized deployment for easy setup and upgrades</li>
</ul>

<p>
  With DCN, communities regain control over their digital lives—hosting data locally, customizing tools to their needs, and federating only by choice. It reflects core values of <em>sustainability, autonomy, and resilience</em>.
